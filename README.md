# Bug Busters (Software Architectures Assignment)

## My Project
A tower defence game where the user plays as the body's immune system and helps defend against a
series of pathogens. Different towers are effective against differnt pathogens, ie) The anit-biotic
tower will be effective against Bacteria, but will be useless against a Virus. This will teach the 
player that certain medicines only work against certain pathogens.

### Design Patterns Implemented

 - Factory: Used to create Towers for the player to place on the map, and all the pathogens that 
 are spawned in a wave.
 - Delegation: Used to change the state of pathogens as they are weakened. 
 - (POSSIBLE) MVC: Used to handle the UI and Screens.

## Specification
A local primary school wishes to use computer applications to help teach very young children to 
learn. You are required to create a single interactive game that teaches primary school children 
some aspect of science in a very colourful and fun way. Coding tasks are: 
 - Use Eclipse (he said IntelliJ was fine in class...)
 - 	Key objects to be drawn to the screen should be instances of subclasses of the GameObject class
 - 	You are required to implement one or more design patterns presented in the module so far 
 (e.g. Delegation, Factory, Command, Singleton, etc)
 - Demonstrate thoughtful ‘responsibility driven design’, for examples with ‘use case’ and sequence
 diagrams. Provide one or more class diagrams.
 - Do not use SceneBuilder or other third party coding tools to assist in the creation of the 
 application.
 - Do not present tic-tack-toe, reversi, arcade clones or anything else that’s obviously from a 
 textbook, a youtube tutorial or demonstrating a lack of imagination or creative programming. __Note 
 coding cynically taken from the web and presented as yours will be considered as plagiarism and the
  maximum penalty for unfair means will be recommended.__ (So no Stack Overflow)
  
  ## For Good Marks
  
  - User Interface (5/50)
    - Outstanding UX which fits the brief perfectly
    - Makes exceptional use of the user interface, graphics, and sound
    - Is simple, intuitive, fun, and pretty.
  - Design (15/50)
    - Outstanding functionality
    - Exceptionally elegant
    - Impeccable choice of classes to encapsulate their respective data and functionality
    - Impeccable use of interfaces
    - Exceptional design
    - Exceptionally well thought out and understood application of design patterns
    - Evidence the student has take responsibility for their own learning with application of 
    relevant knowledge acquired beyond the course notes.
  - Implementation (10/50)
    - Impeccable presentation of coding with appropriate comments, naming conventions, and 
    indentations etc.
    - Clearly building on notes and exercises presented throughout the module. Whilst making 
    appropriate choices of knowledge to apply
    - Exceptional creative programming with impressive functionality
    - A good understanding and creative use of the JavaFX2 API beyond that presented in the notes.
  - Report (20/50)
    - An exceptionally well presented report
    - Exceptionally good understanding of topics presented in notes and exercises evident
    - Exceptionally good critique and evaluation of own code.
    - Exceptional use of diagrams to communicate information (Non generated UML diagrams).
    - No Auto-Generated diagrams
    - Report is very easy to read and understand for a typical programmer
    - Evidence the student has read beyond notes to support learning
    - An impeccable sense of the academic as well as practical expectations of a degree level module

## What Ian Said:

 - Intelli J is fine :D
 - Got to subclass a simple GameObject (just to stop plagarism)
 - Implement one or more design patterns (where relevant)
 - don't use scene building
 - ZIP intelliJ project for submission
 - Create a runable JAR file (so don't hardcode file resources)
 - test JAR file on multiple computers BEFORE sumbission
 - 3 - 6 page report of the technical side of how i've built it
 - report uses technical language (I implemented a concrete realisation of the abstract method etc) 
 - the report is worth 40% -> so quite a lot!
