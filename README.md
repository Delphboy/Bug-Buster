# SWA-Assignment
To make an educational game for primary school children, making use of one or more design patterns

## What Ian Said:

 - Intelli J is fine :D
 - Got to subclass a simple GameObject (just to stop plagarism)
 - Implement one or more design patterns (where relevant)
 - don't use scene building
 - ZIP intelliJ project for submission
 - Create a runable JAR file (so don't hardcode file resources)
 - test JAR file on multiple computers BEFORE sumbission
 - 3 - 6 page report of the technical side of how i've built it
 - report uses technical language (I implemented a concrete realisation of the abstract method etc) 
 - the report is worth 40% -> so quite a lot!
