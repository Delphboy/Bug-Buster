\section{Static Model}
Fowler and Kendrall describe Static Models as a truly central part of modelling an object oriented system \cite{UML-Distilled}. They provide an excellent way of communicating the relationships between the classes that make up the system. Static Models also allow for the communication of the attribute and methods held by each each class.
