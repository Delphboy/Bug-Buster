\section{Introduction}
Producing easy to understand, universal design documentation for a given scenario is always a challenge worth rising to. Good design documentation does not just demonstrate the technical model of the system, but also includes how users interact with the system along with the stages each process takes. To communicate these additional attributes, the report contains a Use Case Diagram followed by Textual Use Cases that provide further information about the tasks a user may complete. Certain Textual Use Cases are also demonstrated through the use of Activity Diagrams to show all the possible processes that may take place in a given use case. In order to show the different modules within the system, and demonstrate how they will interact, a Static Model is also shown. 
\\
All the diagrams used to demonstrate the system are forms of the Universal Modelling Language (UML). This is because UML provides a way of visualising various aspects of a system in a way that is applicable to a wide range of readers. 

The report shows the various models of the system as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use Case diagram
	\item Textual Use Cases
	\item Static Model (Class Diagram) of the system
	\item Activity Diagrams of two textual use cases
\end{enumerate}
