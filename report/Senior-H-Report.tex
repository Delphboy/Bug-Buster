\section*{Introduction}
When designing and creating software, it is common to think about the end user experience. However, it is also important to consider what software development consultant Kevlin Henney describes as the \textit{``Programmer Experience''}. \cite{FizzBuzz}. This refers to the readability, maintainability, and reusability of the source code. He argues that if programmers cannot understand the source code, then they cannot use it effectively. However, as Gamma \textit{et al} (commonly known as The Gang of Four or GoF) state \textit{`Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder.'} \cite{GoF-Book}. This report explains and evaluations the design decisions taken during the creation of my educational game, Bug Busters, and how they impacted on the; usability, efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and reusability of the source code.
